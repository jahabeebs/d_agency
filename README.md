## Introduction
Thanks for your interest in Developer DAO's agency website! 

To contribute, here are some tips on basic branch management:

The main branch is the production branch; nothing should be merged directly here </br>
The dev branch is where we'll point our stories when we want to merge a PR in GitHub </br> </br>
To create a new branch, try using these naming conventions: </br>
feature/description-of-feature </br>
bugfix/description-of-bugfix </br>
hotfix/description-of-hotfix </br>

Before merging, use the linter command (yarn lint) to check for style errors and potential bugs and resolve these </br>

## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Fork the repo from the Developer DAO repository (https://github.com/Developer-DAO/d_agency)

Now, clone the repo you've forked and run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel
